In 2015, I developed **real-time speech disorder detection software using C++ and the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC)**. This program provides real-time speech data recording, speech end-point detection, and pathological speech detection. It also works for importing audio data. The program computes various speech features, including Jitter, Shimmer, and high-order statistics, and detects pathological speeches based on a pre-trained decision tree model.

## Code Share
For now, this GitHub repository provides C++ source code for **the real-time speech data recording and speech end-point detection parts**. It is compatible with MFC. If you have any questions, please contact me at **husky.jihye.moon@gmail.com**.
