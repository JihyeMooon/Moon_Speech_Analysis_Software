In 2015, I developed real-time speech disorder detection software using C++ and the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC). This program provides real-time speech data recording, speech end-point detection, and pathological speech detection. It also works for importing audio data. The program computes various speech features, including Jitter, Shimmer, and high-order statistics, and detects pathological speeches based on a pre-trained decision tree model.

For now, this GitHub repository provides C++ source code for the real-time speech data recording and speech end-point detection parts. It is compatible with MFC. If you have any questions, please contact me at husky.jihye.moon@gmail.com.
